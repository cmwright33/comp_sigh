Lots of people out there are wondering how to get the binary equivalent of a decimal number and vice-versa.
Let's give the people what they want!

Create a Rails app that converts numbers, much in the way that the currency converter worked.
for the lab. 
It should have a form with a button to converts numbers on the front end using javascript and another button that does it using ruby.
Please include a suite of tests that verify, for example, that the binary equivalent of 13 is 1101.

Extra credit: to give the people even more than they asked for, add a hexadecimal converter to your app.
